Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Steps I Followed
1. Loaded the dataset using pandas
2. Checked basic information and summary statistics
3. Found missing values in some columns like Age and Cabin
4. Created visualizations:
   - Histograms for numeric data
   - Boxplots to detect outliers
   - Correlation heatmap to find relationships
5. Wrote down key insights

Key Insights
- More females survived than males
- 1st class passengers had better survival rates
- Cabin column has a lot of missing data
- Fare values are not evenly distributed — some are very high
- Pclass and Fare are negatively correlated
